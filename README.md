# Hello there! :wave:
  
  My name is <b>Maximilian Mergenthal<b>, I am from <b>Hamburg<b>, <b>Germany<b> and on a journey to become a Web Developer!
  
  ## <em>"Why Web Development ❓"</em>
  
  One Thing i learned from Bear Grylls is:
  
  1. Improvise 🤔
  2. Adapt 📖
  3. Overcome 💪
  
  This wisdom can be applied on the digital Change in Germany. Many Companies are behind in the competitive virtual space and i want to contribute my part
  by developing solutions!

  Seeing the potential career Chances in Web devolping, i made the first step, Improvise (started "neueFische Bootcamp")
  
  
  ## <em>"Which Skills can i provide ❓"
  
  at the moment:
  
  - basic html
  - basic CSS
  - basic javaScript
